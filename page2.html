The Wolf and the Fox is featured in Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics. There were some differences in the plot of this episode. In this version, the Wolf has had terrible hunting skills where he was unable to catch a deer, some rabbits, a family of ducks, and was repelled by a farmer when he tried to target the farmer's cattle. The Wolf has also tried to obtain some followers from a deer, a squirrel, a hawk, and a bear. The Fox ends up taking up the Wolf's previous offer to make him his follower which is where the Wolf makes the Fox obtain food for him. The first part involved fishing from a frozen pond during winter. The Wolf got his tail stuck in the ice which the Fox had to remove at the cost of part of the Wolf's tail. Then in the spring, Fox obtained a fried egg from a farmer's house. The Wolf tried to go for another, but broke one of the dishes giving himself away to the farmer's wife as the farmer beats up the Wolf. After talking with a deer, the Fox comes up with a plan where he takes the recuperated Wolf to a basement containing salted meat. To complete his trap to get rid of the Wolf, the Fox causes a racket to alert a local farmer and the Wolf gets stuck in the hole where he is caught by the farmer. The Fox continued to run and makes it back to the forest. The Fox tells the local animals that the Wolf isn't coming back and states that he is free of him.
There is a song by the metal band Bring Me The Horizon entitled "The Fox and the Wolf" included in the album There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret.. It is unknown if the song is meant to be related to this story in any way besides the name.
